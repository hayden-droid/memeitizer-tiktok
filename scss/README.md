This facilities making the bulma.min.css and fontawesome.min.css files, install all dependencies using:
```
yarn install
```

And then use:
```
yarn bulma && yarn fa
```

This compiles bulma.scss and fontawesome.scss to a css file and helps lowering the size of the css that will be sent to the user.
